<b>Description</b>

<i>Meditation</i> is a truly minimalistic countdown timer for meditation, with a clean user interface and no clutter. The minimalism of the app embodies meditation's actual purpose.

A notable feature of the app is the ability to customize the volume of the notification bells independently of system volume. This allows you to set a predefined volume so that the sounds will reliably play at the same loudness every time. No more mid-meditation worrying that you remembered to turn the volume up!

Another important feature is for the timer to be as reliable as possible, to ensure an accurate meditation time and prompt ending sound notification.
This is achieved by starting a foreground service and disabling battery optimization.

Reliability is of extreme importance to a meditation tool in order to eliminate all possible worries about the timer not behaving correctly. Just press the button and start!
